Shoulda helps you write more understandable, maintainable Rails-specific tests
using Minitest.

The `shoulda` gem doesn't contain any code of its own; it actually brings
behavior from two other gems:

* [Shoulda Context]
* [Shoulda Matchers]

See the READMEs for these projects for more information.

[Shoulda Context]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-context
[Shoulda Matchers]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers

## Overview

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class UserTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  context "associations" do
    should have_many(:posts)
  end

  context "validations" do
    should validate_presence_of(:email)
    should allow_value("user@example.com").for(:email)
    should_not allow_value("not-an-email").for(:email)
  end

  context "#name" do
    should "consist of first and last name" do
      user = User.new(first_name: "John", last_name: "Smith")
      assert_equal "John Smith", user.name
    end
  end
end
```

Here, the `context` and `should` methods come from Shoulda Context; matchers
(e.g. `have_many`, `allow_value`) come from Shoulda Matchers.

## Compatibility

Shoulda is tested and supported against Ruby 2.2-2.4, Rails 4.2-5.0, and
Minitest 5.
